## Image-Caption-Generator

This repository contains implementation of an Image Caption Generator using Deep Learning. The image_caption_generator.ipynb contains the code and Outputs folder contains outputs of the model.
I have used Flickr8K (https://www.kaggle.com/shadabhussain/flickr8k) dataset for images and GloVe (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/glove-global-vectors-for-word-representation) to generate word embedding. Please download these files to the Image-Caption-Generator directory to successfully run the code.

Thank You!
